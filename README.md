## Why open-source software?
***"If the product is free and closed, then you are the product"***  
This project is never made to compete with any other music player, it is just a simple player that I started when I was a programming newbie and whit which I have learned many new things.  
The fact that it is wirtten in a scripting language like python makes it perform worse and slower, as well as having a not very customizable interface due to the the limitations of tcl/tk.  
That is why this is a purely educational project, which must be freely published.
