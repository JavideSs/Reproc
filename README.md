## Why open-source software?
***"If the product is free, then you are the product"***  
Most free closed-source software collect data about you, and you can never know if it has any trojan or spy-wares inside.
With open source, nothing hidden, and source code exposed to thousands of programmers, no one can play dirty games.

Need to mention, this project is never made to compete with any other music player, it is just a simple player that i started when i was a programming newbie and whit which i have learned many new things.  
The fact that it is wirtten in a scripting language like python makes it perform worse and slower, as well as having a not very customizable interface due to the the limitations of tcl/tk.  
That is why this is a purely educational project, which must be freely published.
