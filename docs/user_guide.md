Right clicking on a song, you can rename it, delete it or copy it to another playlist that has been imported in reproc.  
These actions will have a direct consequence on the disk.

## Keyboard shortcuts
- With the **SPACE KEY** you can continue or pause the song.
- With the **ENTER KEY** you can play the selected song in the playlist.
- With **DOUBLE CLICK** you can play the selected song in the playlist.
- With the **RIGHT/LEFT ARROWS KEYS** you can move forward/backward respectively 5s the current song.
- With the **UP/DOWN ARROWS KEYS** you can move through the playlist.

## Extra features

### Thumbnail toolbar
The application in the taskbar has buttons on the thumbnail to pause, continue or play previous or next song.  
This feature is present in Windows systems as of Windows 7.

## Audio formats
Unfortunately the pygame sld2 mixer interface for python only supports ogg for all platforms, and also mp3 for Windows.  
In addition, it is not possible to change the frequency dynamically, if a song is detected with a different frequency than the previous one, the mixer is reinitialized, which means a small delay of 1s.

## Data constancy
When closing the application the application state will be saved in "user_config.json". These are: volume, status of random and loop, selected playlist, language, theme, playlists added to reproc an their filters.

### About "user_config.json"
Json structure:
[user_config.json](../data/user_config.json)

If there is a bug in the application that corrupts the structure, it could be modified directly in this file.  
For now, as there are no options to select theme or language, they can be set directly here.
- Two languages: english ("en") and spanish ("es").
- One theme: white ("normal")

Some theme colors can also be modified directly in this file. For a complete customization the tcl file could be modified.
