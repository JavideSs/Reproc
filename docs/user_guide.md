# Reproc user guide
The interface can be divided into three parts:

- ### Song control
A simple interface with functions common to many players.

(2) Play songs randomly.  
(3) play songs in loop.  
(4) Play previous song.  
(5) Play or pause song.  
(6) Play next song.  
(7) Control volume.  
(8) Information about the current playback*

- ### Playlist
List with all the songs present in the playlist by name and duration.

*(1) Play or pause song.  
(2) Song name.  
(3) Song duration.*

It is sensitive to the mouse movement. When the mouse is passed over a song, it is colored and a button appears that can be clicked to start the song directly.

Right clicking on a song, you can rename it, delete it or copy it to another playlist that has been imported to reproc.  
These actions will have a direct consequence on the disk.

## Keyboard shortcuts
- With the **SPACE KEY** we can continue or pause the song.
- With the **ENTER KEY** we can reproduce the song selected in the playlist.
- With the **RIGHT/LEFT ARROWS KEYS** we can move forward/backward respectively 5s of the current song
- With the **UP/DOWN ARROWS KEYS** we can move through the playlist.

## Audio formats
Unfortunately the pygame sld2 mixer interface for python only supports ogg for all platforms, and also mp3 for windows.  
In addition, it is not possible to change the frequency dynamically, if a song is detected with a different frequency than the previous one, the mixer is reinitialized, which means a small delay of 1s.

## Data constancy
When closing the application the application state will be saved in "user_config.json". These are: volume, status of random and loop, selected playlist, language, theme, playlists added to reproc an their filters.

### About "user_config.json"
Json structure:
[user_config.json](../data/user_config.json)

If there is a bug in the application that corrupts the structure, it could be modified directly in this file.  
For now, as there are no options to select theme or language, they can be set directly here.
- Two languages: english ("en") and spanish ("es").
- One theme: white ("normal")

Some theme colors can also be modified directly in this file. For a complete customization the tcl file could be modified.
